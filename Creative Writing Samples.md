### Myth

Cobourne was a small town and, like all other places, had its own lore.
	
It was said that long ago, there lived a siren—the cavity of her chest cobwebbed and dark for her heart had given up its yearning and lay down, waiting for a reason to beat once more. She felt indifference toward the sailors who remained eternally her only company. She had no need nor desire inside her for their callused and greedy hands, nor did she have the appetite to watch their ships be swallowed by the sea. And so, finally, the siren made her way toward land, seeking a shore bare of ships and sails. When she happened upon the cliffs of Cobourne, she made a home for herself and sang from the rocks to the shore each day as the sun rose and again as it set, unsure of what her song would bring—unsure of what she wanted it to bring. <br>
	
Years before the siren sought haven on Cobourne’s coast, a young man with a peregrine’s eye raised his bow for the first time. Few men born of the town remained on land—sailing equal parts duty and rite—but the boy felt compelled to keep to the dirt and sand, not for fear of the sea, but for some other piece of him that yearned for the earth and its ground. <br>
	
In his formative years, war came to Cobourne by way of sea. He took to the cliffs overlooking the water, where he stood archer and sentry. His arrows made homes in the flesh of his enemies, and he shot fire and fury into ships, watching them sink, engulfed by fire and devoured by water before reaching the shore. Unfailing, the archer fired, protecting Cobourne, until one day, there was no need for the sailors to take to the sea. They moved on, down the coast where their ships might be useful—where they might lead fleets of warships into battle and become the warriors they were destined to be. <br>
	
After the war’s end, for all his days, the archer took his place on the cliff, his feet roots just the same as any grown by a tree, his eyes ever trained on the horizon. It was the only way he knew the sea: an eternal body stretched before him, but never beneath—a friend, but never a bedfellow. He lived each day vigilant but easy—ships dared not test his bow. <br>
	
One morning, as the sun rose, the siren’s song lilted over the breaking waves and drew the archer down from his post. At the base of the cliff, he turned toward the sea, and the siren caught his eye. The milky morning light dripped over them both, gleaming and golden. The waves arched their backs and crashed, fervent as lovers, into the rocks as the siren beckoned the archer nearer. He came as close to her as the rough tide would allow. <br>
	
“I’ve never heard anyone sing quite like you,” the archer said, all wonder. <br>
	
“Nor I you,” the siren said. <br>
	
“How do you mean? My voice doesn’t carry so far as yours. Surely, you’ve never heard it.” <br>
	
“Ah, I’ve heard your arrows sing,” she said. “A song of war—one usually hammered on drums. Yours is more... delicate.” <br>	 

That day, and each following, they poured themselves into one another—he into the sea and she into the sand. It was the beginning of a life together, neither able to leave the other, but each unable to enter the other’s world entirely. They built a home from stone at the base of the cliff, the sea perpetually battering its walls. Together they had a child—a girl with salted skin and bird-like eyes, a magnetic voice and far-reaching sight. <br>
	
The siren looked at the child and said, “I know now, you are who I sought. My song brought me you,” and, finally, her heart beat to life once more. <br>
	
The family lived happily in Cobourne where the sea and shore were married by the tide. The siren brought her sisters ever closer to the shore, where they built a home for themselves, away from sailors and their raucous shanties. Together with the humans, they created a new people, the blood of the sirens coursing through the veins of the town. The new generation of children sang with one foot in the sea and the other on the shore—rooted, firmly as an oak in dirt, so that the tide might not pull them too far out to sea. <br>
	
They were a people destined to remain in Cobourne forever—to protect their home, and to die where they lived. Their collective song was a magnet that none born to the town were strong enough to pull away from. And so it goes that, even after death, their souls sung forever on the seaside, among the reeds, unable to exist in an afterlife that took them from their home. They remained specters eternally finding haven under the watchful eyes of the salt-skinned archers, anchored for eternity to Cobourne’s shore. <br>

**An excerpt from Beatrice Mooney in Perpetuity**

Shall we begin with my childhood? <br> 

I stood, a then-very-small Beatrice Mooney. I was little more than a waif, all bones and angles, easily blown about by a breeze. With every ounce of my ten-year-old self, I screamed from the tip-top of a cliff out into the infinite stretched before me—a guttural sound for such a small creature, as I recall. The earth quaked beneath me and the stars clustered and folded me into the center of the universe, and in that moment—as all the noise of the world collapsed in on me—I slew the greatest of my demons. <br>
	
Why is it that I should tell you the end before the start? I suppose in my thirty years, I've had my fill of surprises and do not wish to unnecessarily bestow one any more than I wish to receive one. Do not be fooled by the happy ending to this tale, for—as you certainly must know—nothing in this life is quite what it seems, and a requirement of happiness is tribulation. You mustn’t ever forget that. <br>
	
 This life is transactional. <br>  
	
Should you fail to continue reading, know that you will also fail to learn the secret I've kept tucked away in my mind all these years with no way of releasing it. You should know: it's yours to have should you desire it. It is only fair that you know the truth before making any decisions. <br> 

### Poetry 

O, sweet Eternity— <br>
her knuckles bared, <br>
skin stretched translucent-thin— <br>
she gripped them tightly: <br>
her palm their ground, <br>
her fingers: bars imprisoning their souls. <br>

And relentless Time— <br>
cyclic and rhapsodic— <br>
forever watched their mortal lives performed, <br>
each an echo of one before, <br>
for we humans are <br>
who and where we’re born from— <br>
we humans are our past. <br>

We live time and again, <br>
time and again. <br>
