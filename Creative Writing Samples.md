## Direct-Address 

**An excerpt from Beatrice Mooney in Perpetuity \(\*a Writers of the Future honorary mention, 2023\):**

Shall we begin with my childhood? <br> 

I stood, a then-very-small Beatrice Mooney. I was little more than a waif, all bones and angles, easily blown about by a breeze. With every ounce of my ten-year-old self, I screamed from the tip-top of a cliff out into the infinite stretched before me—a guttural sound for such a small creature, as I recall. The earth quaked beneath me and the stars clustered and folded me into the center of the universe, and in that moment—as all the noise of the world collapsed in on me—I slew the greatest of my demons. <br>
	
Why is it that I should tell you the end before the start? I suppose in my thirty years, I've had my fill of surprises and do not wish to unnecessarily bestow one any more than I wish to receive one. Do not be fooled by the happy ending to this tale, for—as you certainly must know—nothing in this life is quite what it seems, and a requirement of happiness is tribulation. You mustn’t ever forget that. <br>
	
 This life is transactional. <br>  
	
Should you fail to continue reading, know that you will also fail to learn the secret I've kept tucked away in my mind all these years with no way of releasing it. You should know: it's yours to have should you desire it. It is only fair that you know the truth before making any decisions. <br>

## Hemmingway-Style 

**An excerpt from "Cul-de-Sac":**

I live at 182 Morton Street. My house sits at the exact center of the cul-de-sac with three houses on either side, equidistant, geometric: a perfect vantage point. There are forty-two other houses in the subdivision. The grass is green. The people are chipper, not kind. There’s a difference. But it’s a bland routine they live, stale. The men leave in the morning, suit and tie, come back late in the evening after indulging in what they think is a torrid affair, when in all actuality, it, too, is just as overplayed and lifeless as their marriages. The women are pants-suit-super-moms. They rush about in expensive SUVs, clutching briefcases, holding on for dear life, remaining oblivious to their husbands for what I would label self-preservation. <br> 
    	
Routine. I sit at the window with coffee and the paper. I never read it; it’s not all that interesting, anyhow. I watch my neighbors. I film. I study. I can be like them, I think, if I try. They all leave for work by seven o’clock on the dot, their toddlers strapped in—first stop: daycare. It’s a young neighborhood: young couples with young children in recently built houses, not homes. There’s a difference. I appreciate them, they teach me how to be alive. They really have no idea how much they do for me by simply living. <br> 
	
It’s Monday, so when I walk out of my home, I take a left. I walk past two houses, and there’s the third. I take another left, this time into the driveway. I go up the walk and around to the back. The basement is partially above ground. There is a small window that I left unlocked for myself the first time—the one the family carelessly left open so many months ago. Before sliding in, I check on the flower growing in the dirt against the house; it’s small, delicate, yellow. It makes me happy. I moved it here from my own backyard—a gift for all they do, a testament to all they miss. <br> 
    	
After sliding through the window, I make my way up the stairs through the darkness. I open the door to a different world, a black-and-white world—chic and modern with silver appliances. Slowly, I wash my hands in the kitchen sink. The water rushes up, around, and out of the curved spout. Bubbles pop and form, pop and form. Twenty-five seconds and I’m finished. I dry my hands and begin my morning routine. <br>
	
I start a pot of coffee. This house, the third on the left, has a dark Ethiopian blend that the family grinds fresh each morning. As it brews, I walk into the living room and turn on the television. It’s already on channel four: news. This is what the family watches in the morning as they eat breakfast. They watch from the kitchen, so I do as well. I go back and pour myself coffee. I sit down at the table and drink. I stare intently at the news anchor on the enormous television. He’s handsome; his eyes are kind. He relays disaster after disaster, informs the world of its most flagrant faults. I try out some of the gestures he makes. I imagine someone gesturing to me. <br> 

## Theatrical Monologue 

**Two monologue excerpts from *Fish*, a play in one act:** 

<u>Monologue #1:</u> <br>

**NOAH:** A prologue—an exordium in which I show you the end, which is perhaps an arbitrary moment, perhaps something more: a turning point, a failure, an achievement, no doubt a sum of all things prior—the feelings, thoughts, and actions. Decisions… a man broken down to nothing—or perhaps a man set free. Both or neither. I can tell you for certain it was hot—disgustingly hot. The air weighed too much; it pushed down on shoulders, creating an uncomfortable closeness, making clothes stick to a body like a second skin, another layer to tear through, to crawl out from, to hide beneath. Isn’t it the case that we are all always retreating beneath or clawing through our own skin? <br>

<u>Monologue #2:</u> <br>

**EMILY:** The leaves turn quickly from one color to the next, but every year there’s a brief window when just about all of them are red. If you go up on the mountain and look down, it looks like the entire town is on fire. That Autumn was mild, warm even. The leaves stayed red longer than usual. The town seemed to burn for weeks. It was a good few months. Everything was on fire. Everything was good. <br>

## Epistolary

My love, <br>
	
I sat this morning with my legs dangling over the edge of the bridge that runs over the small creek in the wood. You know the one—just across the moor. The walk is longer than is convenient for a midday break from work, but you must understand that the air and space was necessary to settle my mind. In the silence of the wood—which is altogether a different kind of silence than most, as it is actually quite noisy once one settles into the stillness and is able to hear all the life rustling about in the brush below and the leaves and branches above—I thought of our souls and what might become of them as I am wont to do from time to time. <br> 
	
I’ve decided, I believe, that souls must go somewhere after the decay of their human bodies.  I know, love, that this is no revelation on the part of humankind—I do not think so much of myself as to imply such a thing—but certainly, it must be acknowledged as a personal epiphany worthy of rumination and discussion, as I have never understood life as something that continues after death. You see, to this point—that is to say, prior to the experience of any death significant enough to bear too heavy a weight to carry in my heart—I believed most passionately that we were destined for dirt and nothing more. I am almost certain that this reconsideration of such firm belief, grim though it may be, is a mechanism of self-preservation to be utilized in the battle against the grief that has eaten its way out from inside me and now sits at the fore of my vision, mocking; nevertheless, I cannot discount its credibility or veracity, for I believe it most wholeheartedly down to the core of my being, even as I have only just begun to believe it so ferociously this very afternoon. And despite its status as epiphany, I hesitate to call this intervention in thought divine, but rather the culmination of pragmatic thought and consideration that has spanned over my lifetime. This, I think, is likely because I am still not convinced on the subject of a greater being, and therefore cannot subscribe to such notions as divine intervention. <br> 
	
Down the rabbit hole went—I steeped in such thoughts for the large majority of the afternoon, entirely shirking all responsibilities of the workday without remorse of any kind. Is it not important to care for oneself above others as she wades into the depths of despair—especially as one who does not often find herself in such a mire? <br> 
	
My thoughts were interrupted by the call of a bird that rang above the others; I recognized it as a songbird—a lark perhaps. I cannot rightfully say how long I’d been sitting there on the bridge; I only know that my feet had gone numb from the dangling. It was then that I took off my shoes and lowered myself down onto the smooth rocks of the creek bed. I stood there in the most shallow of shallows—the water rose no higher than my ankle—and considered what the next body would be made of: if not flesh and water—like that rushing about my feet that makes up the present vessel for my soul—then perhaps air, perhaps light. And if the next body does not exist on this plane, this ground, this earth, then where? The sky, as established religions insinuate, seems much too similar to a fairytale for my mind to reconcile, and death seems too large and angry a thing to reduce to the tropes of folklore. On this point, I admit that I reached no definitive answer and determined that I would continue to think of the relocation of our souls in the abstract. Certainly, souls could not be bound to the mere construct of human worlds and universes. I believe such relocation is very likely beyond my imagination. <br> 
	
I realized finally that it had become dark without my noticing. All at once, stars had filled the black void above in their celestial patterns, which also seemed to bear greater meaning than they once had, and I walked slowly back across the moor and into my home, where I now sit and write to you. <br> 
	
I’ve gone on quite long enough—I fear perhaps even too long. Why I write to you of all people on such a dreary topic is this: I now believe that once we’ve moved beyond this life—this plane of existence, this frame of time and confine of space—our souls will be returned to one another, for souls are the creators and vehicles of love, which, beyond all doubt, cannot perish nor be destroyed. I rest more peacefully knowing that whatever makes us up—on whatever plane, in whatever time and space—you and I will find one another, always. Our souls are permanently intermingled and have been since the dawn of all existence. I am certain now that there will never be a time in all of this eternity that surrounds us that we must endure being apart. I am concretely of the mind that you and I and our dearest companions shall forever remain together. I share this with you in hopes that you find peace and comfort in this thought as I have. <br> 

With all my love, <br>
Yours <br>

## Myth

**An excerpt from "Among the Reeds":**

Cobourne was a small town and, like all other places, had its own lore.
	
It was said that long ago, there lived a siren—the cavity of her chest cobwebbed and dark for her heart had given up its yearning and lay down, waiting for a reason to beat once more. She felt indifference toward the sailors who remained eternally her only company. She had no need nor desire inside her for their callused and greedy hands, nor did she have the appetite to watch their ships be swallowed by the sea. And so, finally, the siren made her way toward land, seeking a shore bare of ships and sails. When she happened upon the cliffs of Cobourne, she made a home for herself and sang from the rocks to the shore each day as the sun rose and again as it set, unsure of what her song would bring—unsure of what she wanted it to bring. <br>
	
Years before the siren sought haven on Cobourne’s coast, a young man with a peregrine’s eye raised his bow for the first time. Few men born of the town remained on land—sailing equal parts duty and rite—but the boy felt compelled to keep to the dirt and sand, not for fear of the sea, but for some other piece of him that yearned for the earth and its ground. <br>
	
In his formative years, war came to Cobourne by way of sea. He took to the cliffs overlooking the water, where he stood archer and sentry. His arrows made homes in the flesh of his enemies, and he shot fire and fury into ships, watching them sink, engulfed by fire and devoured by water before reaching the shore. Unfailing, the archer fired, protecting Cobourne, until one day, there was no need for the sailors to take to the sea. They moved on, down the coast where their ships might be useful—where they might lead fleets of warships into battle and become the warriors they were destined to be. <br>
	
After the war’s end, for all his days, the archer took his place on the cliff, his feet roots just the same as any grown by a tree, his eyes ever trained on the horizon. It was the only way he knew the sea: an eternal body stretched before him, but never beneath—a friend, but never a bedfellow. He lived each day vigilant but easy—ships dared not test his bow. <br>
	
One morning, as the sun rose, the siren’s song lilted over the breaking waves and drew the archer down from his post. At the base of the cliff, he turned toward the sea, and the siren caught his eye. The milky morning light dripped over them both, gleaming and golden. The waves arched their backs and crashed, fervent as lovers, into the rocks as the siren beckoned the archer nearer. He came as close to her as the rough tide would allow. <br>
	
“I’ve never heard anyone sing quite like you,” the archer said, all wonder. <br>
	
“Nor I you,” the siren said. <br>
	
“How do you mean? My voice doesn’t carry so far as yours. Surely, you’ve never heard it.” <br>
	
“Ah, I’ve heard your arrows sing,” she said. “A song of war—one usually hammered on drums. Yours is more... delicate.” <br>	 

That day, and each following, they poured themselves into one another—he into the sea and she into the sand. It was the beginning of a life together, neither able to leave the other, but each unable to enter the other’s world entirely. They built a home from stone at the base of the cliff, the sea perpetually battering its walls. Together they had a child—a girl with salted skin and bird-like eyes, a magnetic voice and far-reaching sight. <br>
	
The siren looked at the child and said, “I know now, you are who I sought. My song brought me you,” and, finally, her heart beat to life once more. <br>
	
The family lived happily in Cobourne where the sea and shore were married by the tide. The siren brought her sisters ever closer to the shore, where they built a home for themselves, away from sailors and their raucous shanties. Together with the humans, they created a new people, the blood of the sirens coursing through the veins of the town. The new generation of children sang with one foot in the sea and the other on the shore—rooted, firmly as an oak in dirt, so that the tide might not pull them too far out to sea. <br>
	
They were a people destined to remain in Cobourne forever—to protect their home, and to die where they lived. Their collective song was a magnet that none born to the town were strong enough to pull away from. And so it goes that, even after death, their souls sung forever on the seaside, among the reeds, unable to exist in an afterlife that took them from their home. They remained specters eternally finding haven under the watchful eyes of the salt-skinned archers, anchored for eternity to Cobourne’s shore. <br>

## Poetry 

O, sweet Eternity— <br>
her knuckles bared, <br>
skin stretched translucent-thin— <br>
she gripped them tightly: <br>
her palm their ground, <br>
her fingers: bars imprisoning their souls. <br>

And relentless Time— <br>
cyclic and rhapsodic— <br>
forever watched their mortal lives performed, <br>
each an echo of one before, <br>
for we humans are <br>
who and where we’re born from— <br>
we humans are our past. <br>

We live time and again, <br>
time and again. <br>

## Musical Theatre Lyric 

**An excerpt from "Lydia" a short musical (\*featured at NYC's Prospect Theatre Company's Musical Theatre Lab, 2019):** 

LYDIA, <br>
MY LYDIA— <br>
I’LL BE LIKE THE CRICKETS IN THE TREES, THE LEAVES IN THE BREEZE, <br>
THE YELLOW ON THE BEES: <br>
ALWAYS THERE; I’LL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE. LYDIA, I’LL BE THERE FOR YOU. <br>

**An excerpt from *Bohemia Burning*, a musical (\*received a 29-hour equity reading, 2018):** 

WHAT WILL NICK SEE WHEN HE LOOKS? <br>
WILL HE KNOW I’M NOT WHO HE REMEMBERS? <br>
WILL HE SEE THESE NEW EMBERS INSIDE ME <br>
THAT ARE CATCHING AND HIDING THE OLD ME? <br>

I FEEL SOMETHING SMOLD’RING DOWN INSIDE ME; <br> 
THE SMOKE IS SLOWLY FILLING UP MY CHEST. <br>
I FEEL EACH BREATH GETTING CAUGHT IN MY THROAT, <br> 
AND EV’RY DAY SEEMS A BIT WORSE AT BEST. <br>
I REMEMBER A TIME WHEN YOU LET ME BE, <br>
BUT IT’S STARTING TO BLUR, I CONFESS. <br>
I CAN’T SEE THE WORLD BEYOND YOU <br>
‘CAUSE SMOKE’S HIDING ALL OF THE REST. <br>

WHAT WILL NICK SEE WHEN HE LOOKS? <br>
WILL HE THINK I’M UNHINGED LIKE THEY PAINT ME? <br> 
WILL HE SEE HOW MY PAST STAYS INSIDE ME— <br>
HOW YOU TWIST AND YOU BEND AND DEFINE ME? <br>

I FEEL MYSELF BURNING FROM THE INSIDE; <br>
THE HEAT’S BECOMING MORE THAN I CAN TAKE. <br>
I FEEL THE THOUGHTS IN MY MIND TIED IN KNOTS, <br> 
AND ANY DAY NOW, THAT ROPE’S GONNA BREAK. <br>

I FORGOT WHAT IT’S LIKE TO HAVE ANY PRIDE— <br>
I GIVE AND I GIVE AND YOU TAKE. <br>
I’M TELLING YOU THIS HAS TO STOP <br>
‘CAUSE BURNING DOES MORE THAN JUST ACHE. <br>

WHAT WILL NICK SEE WHEN HE LOOKS? <br>
WILL HE WATCH AS I SLIP INTO MADNESS? <br>
WILL HE LEAVE AS THE FLAMES OVERCOME ME— <br>
WILL HE KNOW IT’S YOU STRIKING THE MATCHES? <br>
I’M BURNING. <br>
