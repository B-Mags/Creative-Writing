**An excerpt from Beatrice Mooney in Perpetuity**

Shall we begin with my childhood? <br> 

I stood, a then-very-small Beatrice Mooney. I was little more than a waif, all bones and angles, easily blown about by a breeze. With every ounce of my ten-year-old self, I screamed from the tip-top of a cliff out into the infinite stretched before me—a guttural sound for such a small creature, as I recall. The earth quaked beneath me and the stars clustered and folded me into the center of the universe, and in that moment—as all the noise of the world collapsed in on me—I slew the greatest of my demons. <br>
	
Why is it that I should tell you the end before the start? I suppose in my thirty years, I've had my fill of surprises and do not wish to unnecessarily bestow one any more than I wish to receive one. Do not be fooled by the happy ending to this tale, for—as you certainly must know—nothing in this life is quite what it seems, and a requirement of happiness is tribulation. You mustn’t ever forget that. <br>
	
 This life is transactional. <br>  
	
Should you fail to continue reading, know that you will also fail to learn the secret I've kept tucked away in my mind all these years with no way of releasing it. You should know: it's yours to have should you desire it. It is only fair that you know the truth before making any decisions. <br> 

### Poetry 

O, sweet Eternity— <br>
her knuckles bared, <br>
skin stretched translucent-thin— <br>
she gripped them tightly: <br>
her palm their ground, <br>
her fingers bars imprisoning their souls. <br>

And relentless Time— <br>
cyclic and rhapsodic— <br>
forever watched their mortal lives performed, <br>
each an echo of one before, <br>
for we humans are <br>
who and where we’re born from— <br>
we humans are our past. <br>

We live time and again, <br>
time and again. <br>
